##Inception

This was a group project where we were all trying to learn ionic aa the phaser.js library.
We each created our own level and got to the point where we felt like we were able to integrate
the js libraries.

###Problmes
ionic doesn't play well with phaser and phaser also doesn't play well with cordova.
This seems to be a big problem. We are looking at another hybrid platform that we can use
to implement the game
